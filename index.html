      I use GitHub for various random things, so I decided that I will list the
      ones that I think are worth looking into here:
    </p>

        <a href="https://github.com/E-Terry/mr-reed-physics">Mr-Reed-Physics:</a

        This repository hosts a website that contains two main things, both
        relating to documenting a physics class I took in high school:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://e-terry.github.io/mr-reed-physics/animations/"
              >Animations:</a
            ><span class="language">Python</span> A page for myself and Patrick
            to make things in Manim, the math animation library created by
            3Blue1Brown, for our physics class.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://e-terry.github.io/mr-reed-physics/notes/">Notes:</a
            ><span class="language">LaTeX</span> A page to view the notes we
            took in LaTeX from the same physics class.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/E-Terry/ToDoList">ToDoList:</a
        ><span class="language">HTML/CSS/JS</span

        My first foray into HTML and React, a website where you input the things
        you have to do and a bit of information about them, that then
        automatically sorts them based on how important they are. This could use
        to be updated some to be more usable for most people, like adding a
        login and saving through accounts, editting the decision matrices
        easily, and generally making the UI nicer.
      </li>

        These are just a few little independant programs to do interesting
        things that my friend Patrick wanted and I couldnâ€™t find a good solution
        to on the internet. These should be set up as command line programs, but
        since I only used them once or twice they donâ€™t have command line
        arguments setup right now. The programs in this currently are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>ReverseChromaKey:</i> For some reason Patrick needed a program
            that took a frame, and removed every pixel that isnâ€™t a certain
            color, like the opposite of a chromakey, which removes every pixel
            that isnâ€™t a color. I should add actual command line arguments to
            this and make it more functional, but it works for now if you edit
            the source code to reflect where the files you want are located.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Kaprekarâ€™s Constant:</i> Kaprekarâ€™s constant is a cool thing to
            look up on wikipedia, and me and Patrick were just looking for some
            cool patterns or anything in the number of iterations. It just goes
            through all 3 digit numbers and outputs a csv of the number of
            iterations it takes to get back to kaprekarâ€™s constant. (Tiny note
            with this one, some people say you should ignore leading zeros when
            calculating Kaprekarâ€™s, and some people disagree. This version
            respects leading zeros, but you could disable one function in it in
            order to change that.)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

        If you dig really deep into my github you can also find my old robotics
        work, but that isn't really the most clear to see what it does without a
        robot in front of you, especially with all of the SDKs and Libraries
        involved, but more power to you if you choose to.
      </li>
    </ul>
