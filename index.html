      I use GitHub for various random things, so I decided that I will list the
      ones that show some of my skills and interests here.

        This repository hosts a website that contains two main things, both
        relating to documenting a physics class I took in high school:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://e-terry.github.io/mr-reed-physics/animations/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Animations:</a
            ><span class="language">Python</span> A page for myself and a
            classmate to make expanatory animations in Manim, the math animation
            library created by 3Blue1Brown, for our physics class.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://e-terry.github.io/mr-reed-physics/notes/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Notes:</a
            ><span class="language">LaTeX</span> A page to view the notes we
            took in LaTeX from the same physics class.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

        My first foray into HTML and React, a website where you input the things
        you have to do and a bit of information about them, that then
        automatically sorts them based on how important they are, telling you
        which to do first.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/E-Terry/ProjectsForPatrick"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"

        These are just a few little independant programs to do interesting
        things that my friend Patrick wanted and I couldnâ€™t find a good solution
        to on the internet. The programs in this currently are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>ReverseChromaKey:</i> For some reason Patrick needed a program
            that took a frame, and removed every pixel that isnâ€™t a certain
            color, like the opposite of a chromakey, which removes every pixel
            that isnâ€™t a color.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Kaprekarâ€™s Constant:</i> Kaprekar's constant has to do with
            recursively taking 3 digit numbers, subtracting the number with
            digits ordered lowest to higest from it with highest to lowest, and
            then doing the same to the result. We wanted to verify that this
            works for all 3 digit numbers, so this iterates through all, and
            outputs the number of iterations as a csv in case there are cool
            patterns to investigate.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

        If you dig really deep into my github you can also find my old robotics
        work, but that isn't really the most clear to see what it does without a
        robot in front of you, especially with all of the SDKs and Libraries
        involved, but more power to you if you choose to.
      </li>
    </ul>
