# Hey, I'm Eli

I'm a soon to be Computer Engineering Student at North Carolina State University, and I sometimes put things I do on github.

On my account, expect to find random, often halfway completed projects that are sometimes kinda cool, and have no expectation of them being easy to work with.

As for background, I was the lead programmer on my FTC Robotics team for a number of years, so I have a lot of experience with Java, but for other things I have worked with a lot of Javascript, a fair amount of HTML and CSS, some Python, and tiny bits of Kotlin. I will every once and a while just decide to use a new language or learn a new thing, so nothing is off the table for me. (C++ might be on the chopping block next)

I make things whenever the inspiration strikes me or whenever my friends complain about a problem I think I could fix, or posit an interesting software idea. 

Currently, I am looking for internship positions in software or other kinds of engineering positions. I am located in the Durham, NC area. Feel free to contact me at e.terry1135@gmail.com and browse a few of my projects with some comments on my [website](https://e-terry.github.io/E-Terry/).

Thanks for reading!
